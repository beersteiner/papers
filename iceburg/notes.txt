This is just a notes file to keep track of how I'm doing things for later documentation.


Create small json file from large json file:
    'create_tiny.sh <infile> <outfile>' # grabs first 500K from large json file
    'clean.sh <infile> <outfile>'       # extract each json object from array
                                          and puts on a new line, ready for SQL import

Populate SQL tables with json data:
    CREATE TABLE tablename (idn INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL UNIQUE, img JSON, PRIMARY KEY (idn))
    LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '<path to json file>' INTO TABLE tablename (img)'

Example JSON queries in SQL:
    # gets 0th index of band_1 from image 'dfd5f913'
    select img->"$.band_1[0]" from train where img->"$.id"="dfd5f913"
